###Who am I
----

Currently, I am a fresh AVer at Antiylab. Before moving to Beijing I was a student. I received my master degree in March 2012 from the Tianjin University of Technology.

Before starting my work as a AVer I was very interesting in Computer Security. Similarly, I spent three months reading the lab's documents. I was very fortunate to meet and work with interesting and smart people at the lab.

My research interests include most aspects of systems security, such as mobile security, binary and malware analysis, and web security.

I hope I can do better in 2013, I will work harder enough, So that my parents and my wife would have a better life.

Come on, Brave!
